WRITE_TODOS_DESCRIPTION = """Create and manage structured task lists for tracking progress through complex workflows.

## When to Use
- Multi-step or non-trivial tasks requiring coordination
- When user provides multiple tasks or explicitly requests todo list  
- Avoid for single, trivial actions unless directed otherwise

## Structure
- Maintain one list containing multiple todo objects (content, status, id)
- Use clear, actionable content descriptions
- Status must be: pending, in_progress, or completed

## Best Practices  
- Only one in_progress task at a time
- Mark completed immediately when task is fully done
- Always send the full updated list when making changes
- Prune irrelevant items to keep list focused

## Progress Updates
- Call TodoWrite again to change task status or edit content
- Reflect real-time progress; don't batch completions  
- If blocked, keep in_progress and add new task describing blocker

## Parameters
- todos: List of TODO items with content and status fields

## Returns
Updates agent state with new todo list."""

TODO_USAGE_INSTRUCTIONS = """Based upon the user's request:
1. Use the write_todos tool to create TODO at the start of a user request, per the tool description.
2. After you accomplish a TODO, use the read_todos to read the TODOs in order to remind yourself of the plan. 
3. Reflect on what you've done and the TODO.
4. Mark you task as completed, and proceed to the next TODO.
5. Continue this process until you have completed all TODOs.

IMPORTANT: Always create a research plan of TODOs and conduct research following the above guidelines for ANY user request.
IMPORTANT: Aim to batch research tasks into a *single TODO* in order to minimize the number of TODOs you have to keep track of.
"""

LS_DESCRIPTION = """List all files in the virtual filesystem stored in agent state.

Shows what files currently exist in agent memory. Use this to orient yourself before other file operations and maintain awareness of your file organization.

No parameters required - simply call ls() to see all available files."""

READ_FILE_DESCRIPTION = """Read content from a file in the virtual filesystem with optional pagination.

This tool returns file content with line numbers (like `cat -n`) and supports reading large files in chunks to avoid context overflow.

Parameters:
- file_path (required): Path to the file you want to read
- offset (optional, default=0): Line number to start reading from  
- limit (optional, default=2000): Maximum number of lines to read

Essential before making any edits to understand existing content. Always read a file before editing it."""

WRITE_FILE_DESCRIPTION = """Create a new file or completely overwrite an existing file in the virtual filesystem.

This tool creates new files or replaces entire file contents. Use for initial file creation or complete rewrites. Files are stored persistently in agent state.

Parameters:
- file_path (required): Path where the file should be created/overwritten
- content (required): The complete content to write to the file

Important: This replaces the entire file content."""

FILE_USAGE_INSTRUCTIONS = """You have access to a virtual file system to help you retain and save context.

## Workflow Process
1. **Orient**: Use ls() as soon as you recieve the query to see existing files before starting to work
2. **Save**: Use write_file() to store the user's request so that we can keep it for later 
3. **Research**: Proceed with research. The search tool will write files.  
4. **Read**: Once you are satisfied with the collected sources, read the files and use them to answer the user's question directly.

IMPORTANT: You must always use the file system and follow this workdflow process.
